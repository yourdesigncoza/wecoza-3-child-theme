I'll help you update the README.md file to accurately reflect the current state of the project. Let me first examine the existing README and the codebase structure to ensure I maintain useful information while updating it appropriately.

Now, let me gather more information about the MVC architecture and recent changes to ensure the updated README is accurate:

Let me also check for any testing setup and recent UI changes:

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I'll now create an updated README.md file that accurately reflects the current state of the project:

Now I have all the information I need to create an updated README.md file. Here's the updated content:

## MVC Architecture

The codebase follows a strict MVC architecture for better organization and maintainability:

### Models
Models represent data structures and business logic. They handle data relationships between entities. Note: Server-side validation has been removed - all validation is handled on the frontend using JavaScript and Bootstrap validation.

```
/app/Models/
  /Learner/
  /Client/
  /Assessment/
  /Portfolio/
```

### Views
Views handle presentation logic. They should not contain business logic and use template partials for reusable components.

```
/app/Views/
  /learner/
  /client/
  /admin/
  /components/
  /layouts/
```

### Controllers
Controllers handle the request/response cycle. They implement WordPress hooks as entry points and use service classes for complex operations.

```
/app/Controllers/
  LearnerController.php
  ClientController.php
  AssessmentController.php
  ClassController.php
  PublicHolidaysController.php
  ...
```

### Services
Services implement business logic and handle complex operations. They manage external integrations, caching, and file operations.

```
/app/Services/
  /Database/
  /FileUpload/
  /Authentication/
  /Export/
```

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0+
- GeneratePress theme 3.0+ (parent theme)
- PHP 8.0+
- MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.3+
- PostgreSQL 12+ (optional)
- Node.js 16+ (for development)
- Composer (for PHP dependencies)

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### Development Workflow
The project follows a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:
1. Write tests that define the expected behavior
2. Implement the code to make the tests pass
3. Refactor the code while ensuring tests continue to pass
4. No task should be marked as "Completed" until all associated tests are written and passing

### Branching Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch
- Feature branches: `feature/WEC-[ticket]-description`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/WEC-[ticket]-description`
- Release branches: `release/v[major].[minor].[patch]`

### Build Process
```bash
# Development build
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Package theme for distribution
./package-theme.sh
```

### Testing
The project uses PHPUnit for PHP testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Run specific test suite
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite Unit
