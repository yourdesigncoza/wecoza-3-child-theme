## Your Optimized WECOZA-DEV Workflow

Here's a summary of your new optimized workflow:

1. **Linear for Task Management**
   - Use Linear MCP directly for creating, retrieving, and updating tasks
   - Leverage Linear's native features for tracking progress

2. **Sequential Thinking for Planning**
   - Retain the sequential_thinking MCP for structured breakdown
   - Apply this to new features before implementation

3. **WECOZA-DEV Templates for Structure**
   - Use your new file-based template system for comprehensive task documentation
   - Follow the TDD approach defined in your guides

4. **Task Tracking in Your Codebase**
   - Maintain TASK_LIST.md as a codebase-integrated view of your tasks
   - Track implementation sequence and dependencies there

## Next Steps

To fully transition to this optimized workflow:

1. **Create Standard Prompts**
   - Develop a few standard prompts to replace common taskmanager operations
   - For example: "Create a WECOZA-DEV task from Linear issue WEC-XX"

2. **Team Communication**
   - Share the new workflow with your team
   - Point them to the quick reference guide for an easy overview

3. **Start Small**
   - Begin with a single, manageable feature
   - Apply the full workflow from start to finish as a test case

4. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Gather feedback after using the process
   - Make adjustments to templates and guides as needed

## Example Starter Prompts

Here are some example prompts you can use with your AI assistant to replace taskmanager functions:

```
"Convert Linear issue WEC-XX to a WECOZA-DEV task document following our template and save as WEC-XX-task.md"

"Create a test checklist for WEC-XX following our TDD guidelines and save as WEC-XX-test-checklist.md"

"Update TASK_LIST.md with the status change of WEC-XX-1 to 'In Progress'"

"Check which tasks are ready to start based on our implementation sequence and current completed tasks"
```
