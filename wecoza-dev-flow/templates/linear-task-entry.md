# \[Feature Title]

## Description

\[Provide a clear, concise description of the feature or requirement]

\[Include any additional context, background information, software requirements or script dependencies]


## Quality Assurance Criteria

1. **MVP Scope Adherence**
   * Implement only essential MVP features in this release. Postpone non-critical enhancements to later iterations.

2. **Integration Validation**
   * Confirm this component integrates seamlessly with existing modules. Test data flow, hook/filter execution, and ensure no conflicts with other parts of the plugin.

3. **No Duplicate Functionality**
   * Reuse existing functions or utilities. Avoid adding new code that duplicates existing logic or introduces redundant features.

4. **WordPress Best Practices**
   * Follow WordPress coding standards and APIs. Sanitize and validate inputs, escape outputs, and use nonces as needed. Enqueue scripts and styles correctly, and document any custom hooks with a unique prefix.

5. **LLM-Friendly Structure**
   * Present each criterion as a numbered item with a clear title and concise description. Use consistent formatting and bullet styles to facilitate automated parsing by LLMs.

## Implementation Sequence

1. First implement WEC-XX-1 (\[Component Name\]) – \[Brief reason for starting here\]  
2. Then implement WEC-XX-2 (\[Component Name\]) – \[Dependencies on previous steps\]  
3. Next implement WEC-XX-3 (\[Component Name\]) – \[Dependencies on previous steps\]  
4. Finally implement WEC-XX-4 (Quality Assurance) – \[Quality Assurance\]  
5. Conclude with WEC-XX-5 (Summary) – \[Summarize the implementation\] 

## Dependencies
* Task WEC-XX-1 depends on WEC-YY-3 being completed first

## Subtasks

* [ ] **WEC-XX-1: \[First Major Component]**
  **Quality Assurance Criteria:**

  * **Security:** Validate and sanitize all inputs. Escape outputs with WP functions (e.g., `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`) and use nonces for forms/actions.
  * **Compatibility:** Test with the latest WP core and major plugins/themes; ensure no conflicts.
  * **Code Readability & Maintainability:** Write clean, modular code with clear naming. Break complex logic into functions or classes.
  * **WP APIs & Hooks:** Use core APIs/hooks instead of direct queries. Document any custom hooks with a unique prefix.
  * **Asset Enqueuing:** Enqueue assets via `wp_enqueue_script/style` only where needed; avoid inline assets.
  * **Coding Standards:** Follow WordPress PHP, JS, and CSS standards. Pass PHPCS/lint checks.
  * **Documentation:** Add PHPDoc blocks for new functions/classes and inline comments for complex logic. Update user/developer docs as needed.

* [ ] **WEC-XX-2: \[Second Major Component]**
  **Quality Assurance Criteria:**

  * **Security:** Sanitize inputs, escape outputs, use nonces.
  * **Compatibility:** Verify across WP core versions and popular plugins/themes.
  * **Code Readability & Maintainability:** Keep code concise and well-structured.
  * **WP APIs & Hooks:** Leverage core functions and hooks; avoid custom SQL.
  * **Asset Enqueuing:** Properly enqueue scripts/styles only on relevant pages.
  * **Coding Standards:** Adhere to WP standards; no linting errors.

* [ ] **WEC-XX-3: \[Third Major Component]**
  **Quality Assurance Criteria:**

  * **Security:** Sanitize and escape all data; use nonces.
  * **Compatibility:** Ensure it works with various themes/plugins and degrades gracefully.
  * **Code Readability & Maintainability:** Modular, clear code structure.
  * **WP APIs & Hooks:** Use appropriate hooks (e.g., `init`, `admin_menu`) and core functions.
  * **Asset Enqueuing:** Enqueue assets conditionally with unique handles.
  * **Coding Standards:** No PHP notices/warnings and no JS console errors; follow coding standards.

* [ ] **WEC-XX-4: \[Quality Assurance]**
  **Quality Assurance Criteria:**  
  - Full integration validation across core plugin modules  
  - Compatibility checks with latest WordPress core and major plugins/themes  
  - Security audit: sanitization, escaping, and nonce verification  
  - Performance sanity check: page load and memory profiling  
  - Code quality review: PSR compliance, no complex/duplicated code  
  - WP best practices: use of APIs/hooks, proper asset enqueuing  
  - User acceptance testing: end-to-end testing of all user scenarios  

  **Implementation Details:**  
  - Conduct thorough testing of the implemented features  
  - Verify compatibility with WordPress core and major plugins/themes  
  - Audit security measures: sanitization, escaping, and nonce usage  

  **Status Transitions:**

- [ ] **WEC-XX-5: Summary**  
  - **Summary:**  
    - Update the WEC-xx-task.md file with an implementation summary covering:  
      - What was fixed (checkbox toggle bug in Public Holidays list).  
      - Files and functions modified.  
      - Any known limitations or next steps.  

  - **Status Transitions:**
