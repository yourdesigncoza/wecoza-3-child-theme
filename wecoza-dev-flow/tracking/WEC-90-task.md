# Optimize Class CRUD Flow - Refactor to Proper MVC Architecture

## Description
Refactor the current class management system from a mixed single-form approach to a proper, optimized CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) flow following MVC architecture best practices. The current implementation has become complex with mixed responsibilities, conditional logic scattered throughout views, and inefficient data handling.

The current system uses a single form with mode switching (`?mode=update&class_id=23`) which has led to:
- Complex conditional logic in views
- Mixed responsibilities in controllers
- Inefficient data fetching
- Poor separation of concerns
- Difficult maintenance and testing

As shown in the current UI:
- Single form handling both create and update modes
- Complex JavaScript for form population
- Mixed read-only and editable fields in same view
- URL parameter inconsistencies
- Scattered validation logic

## Implementation Sequence
1. First implement WEC-90-1 (Repository Pattern & Data Layer) - Establish clean data access foundation
2. Then implement WEC-90-2 (Dedicated Controllers) - Separate CRUD operations into distinct controller methods
3. Next implement WEC-90-3 (Dedicated Views) - Create separate views for each CRUD operation
4. Then implement WEC-90-4 (Routing & URL Structure) - Implement clean RESTful URLs
5. Finally implement WEC-90-5 (Testing & Migration) - Comprehensive testing and smooth migration

## Related Issues
- Current mixed-mode form complexity
- Performance issues with multiple data fetches
- Maintenance difficulties due to scattered logic
- Testing challenges with current architecture

## Technical Approach
Implement a clean separation of concerns using:

1. **Repository Pattern**: Centralize all data access logic
2. **Service Layer**: Handle business logic and complex operations
3. **Dedicated Controllers**: One method per CRUD operation
4. **View Separation**: Distinct templates for each operation
5. **RESTful Routing**: Clean, predictable URL structure
6. **Optimized JavaScript**: Separate scripts for different operations
7. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
8. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient queries and caching

This approach will result in:
- Easier maintenance and debugging
- Better testability
- Improved performance
- Cleaner code organization
- Better user experience
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements
