# Implement Export to PDF Feature

## Description
Add functionality to export learner or agent data to PDF format. This feature will allow users to generate well-formatted PDF documents containing learner or agent information for offline use, printing, or sharing with stakeholders.

The implementation should follow the MVC architecture pattern and integrate with the existing data models. The PDF export functionality should provide a consistent, professional-looking output that maintains the WeCoza branding and styling.

As shown in the UI:
- Export button/link in the learner and agent listing pages
- Options to select which data fields to include in the export
- Progress indicator during PDF generation
- Download prompt or direct download of the generated PDF
- Consistent styling with the WeCoza brand guidelines
