Refactoring code means restructuring existing source code to improve its internal structure without changing its external behavior. It focuses on enhancing readability, maintainability, and efficiency.

The codebase follows an MVC architecture:

### Controllers (`/app/Controllers/`)

### Models (`/app/Models/`)

### Views (`/app/Views/`)

### MVC-Based Shortcodes (Development)

The following shortcodes are implemented as stubs in the MVC controllers:

- `[wecoza_assessment_capture]` - Assessment capture form (placeholder)
- `[wecoza_assessment_display]` - Assessment display functionality (placeholder)
