# Meeting Transcript

## Actual Zoom Meeting Transcript :

Let's start at the top. Client name. Let's say Aspen Pharmacare. Oh, you will see that my thing is on the top left.

to my dropdowns. That's nothing, that's not the program, that's my system. I try to sort it out. That has to do with my Ubuntu or whatever. Yes, because Ubuntu is so good, but it's on the other side. Yes, but anyway, I've been bad at everything. Yes, no, that's fine. So there, you select for example Aspen Pharmacare, the class,

This bit can be used later for an address or a subgroup, understand? Yes. And if you select it, there are automatically addresses, but this information comes from the client's database, from the table. Yes. We're going to do a class schedule. It comes from their class schedule for Thursday the 27th. So basically you select,

Type of class, JETC, Business Admin Package, Joiner, EPP, Skills Programs, AET, Description of the class, Start time, 8 hours, End time, 10 hours, Save event. How do you save an event? It's not good that I don't know if it should work or not, because I already saved it.

Did I just check again? I still have some work to do on the street, maybe I'm going to vlog again. I think I'm going to look again. Where did he go? Oh, you know what? I have to put the time right. I have to put something in there to check it. Anyway. So that's one class. I'll come back after a while. It's the same class, I'll come back as a joiner. Time, I'll come back at 3.30.

So, I don't know, you can comment on that. So, my idea is a little bit... I think you're definitely on the right track. What I would like to do with you is...

I don't know if you can keep that example of the schedule that I sent you. If we now say, for example, we click on the 10th, and we say that the class starts on the 10th and every Thursday at that time and that time. Then he has to, until when you have the stop date, he has to populate for every Thursday, he has to show that there is a class for that day. Yes.

Then we have to be able to say, for example, if a client called in one day and canceled, we have to be able to go on that day and say, the client canceled this day. So that we can't influence the rest of the schedule, but on that specific day, the client canceled, for example. And then we also have to be able to figure out what can happen with the deliveries, what can happen with the exams, the preparation for exams, so everything that is related to the class, we have to be able to figure out and populate in advance.

Okay. All right. Um, yeah. All right. Yes. All right. So here's our class type. Start date.

Mathematics class, I stop start date. Do you understand? Yes. So, the date he's going to stop, let me say, that class. You see what needs to happen here? If he selects here, he automatically gets this class, this date. Yes. Do you understand? To get to what you just mentioned.

Correct, yes. You have to put those dates on your schedule. The problem with a calendar, or a calendar style like this, you are actually a little bit limited to be able to do it yourself. But wait, I'm not going to explain that now. Okay, so we said to put the date on the calendar, it has to be repeating per week, for example.

Then it should fall back to this stop date and restart date. Yes. Correct. So that information there and that information here must work together. Must work together, yes. I kind of had such an idea, I just don't know ... I just don't know if it will still add up. Then I'm going to see if I can, as you say, maybe build everything here. Or ...

If you select here, it will populate so that you can add more dates. Will it be easier to get the goods on the calendar itself, or will it be easier if the calendar is there and as you honor,

you can let all these types of goods sit and work back to the calendar. Yes, so that the calendar is a visual display instead of the actual input. It won't be easier. The calendar is just for visually to see everything and to see the planning, but all the other goods you do separately and independently. All right, so that's a good point there. So how do I create, here below, everything to populate the calendar?

That is half easier. And what we can say here is that it has to populate in the calendar by month and by week. Yes, just like Google Calendar gives you a color block. Yes, yes. Okay, I will just make a more detailed doc summary of the type of events that they should be able to participate in and the dates that they should be able to choose. So that we can put everything on the same day.

Can you do that for me today? I'm definitely going to do it. I'm going to tell you why. We don't have to do this for a long time, because I forget what we talked about. Yeah, I'm definitely going to do it. I'm not the smartest. We don't believe you. It was the day after the last meeting. The summary he made of the meeting, because he's African, is very fucked up.

I can't even use it. So I don't know if you can download the meeting, the whole file. Yes, I can. Can you? Yes. Then you have to upload it for me to download it. I tried it last, but I don't know if it's big enough for the trailer. He didn't want to upload it, so I'll just do it separately for you and then he'll help me. Yes, it's in a Dropbox or something, and then there's a link.

Then I can go back and listen to what we talked about and say, okay, that makes sense to me. So I understand now, I'm going to work on this, that he's going to work from the calendar, but from the input calendar now. I think that's going to be easier. Then I'm going to take this whole interface away and work with it.

I don't think we're going to go very far. I think we're going to go to the next point. Give me feedback. Give me the information that I can quickly build something out of it. And then we can come back to that. If we go through everything and then come back to the other good. Because this calendar is very important. And it's a lot of work. It's a lot of background that goes into it. Let's look at funding and exam details.

So what kind of class is this? Is it a CETA funded? Yes, it's a CETA. Okay, select the CETA. Is it a class, exam class? Then I come and say yes. What kind of exam is this? It's a course exam. Now we have to see people in the class. Then I come and say select that one. Come there, there. Add to class. Okay. As soon as you are in the class, you can select. This is very likely wrong.

Is it a host company learner, walk-in learner or is it a transfer? So here we can put our options, understand? What does it mean? Will a learner be from another company that is in a different place? Am I right or wrong? Yes, that will mostly be community learners. But I will just look at what is in those cases. Yes, I understand. Then we can be like this, so that it fits what you want.

So if there is a community learner in a class, it looks like this. I just said walk-in learner. Comix is community. Then these people will also be assigned to that class. If I say 3 of these guys or 2 of them are going to write an exam, because it's not always all of them, then they are here. So their information here will be linked to the exam type.

OK. OK. Bob Dixon.

That makes 100% sense. The only thing that is still short for us, and that will also be the case in certain cases, will depend on what you can choose in the book. Like us in the book, there we have class type GTC. And that is the Business Mathematics class. So you can choose from this class? Yes. So there you can choose a GTC in Business Mathematics. For example, if we have a GTC, there will be only one

It will be a subject, for example Business Mathematics. But in IT, it will be English and Swiss, and under that there will be levels. So it will be on level 1, 2, 3 or 4. So where will the listener choose? Will we also be able to choose on what level he is? Or we can obviously subtract it from the listener, because we have set it to level 6 and we have entered the placement levels.

So as soon as we download the class, it automatically has to be placed on those placement levels. I think we just have to make sure that we can choose the levels and the goods, or a different one can also be used. But that's just going to be on IET. As I said, how IET chooses, obviously it has to be able to give those options. The rest of the goods do not have those levels. That can then be as soon as it is clear. Okay.

Can you also send me notes on that? Okay, I'll send them to you. Okay, I think... Dirk, do you have something to say? John, just in terms of flow for the user... I mean, I work a lot with this type of stuff and I was confused when I first came here. I was like, okay, where do I start?

I think there is just too much information. I understand the point now where we just want to explain everything, but I think there is too much information for the user from the start. In other words, what I'm trying to say is, if you can only select the class first, then he has to display the next step. Barely a step, barely a multi-step form.

I think it will be a lot more user-friendly. But we also have to keep in mind that the owners who use this platform will get training and they will understand what it is. It's not like someone from the streets who walks in and has to do his banking, you understand? No, no, absolutely, I get it. But I will keep that in mind, it is a good point so that they can't stop and jump.

Yes, or you fill it all in and then you come to the end and you don't understand why you didn't load it in, because you missed something. Yes, but if you say it in class, he really falls for everything you say. Yes, sure, which is great, but I'm just saying. I hear what you're saying, but I also think that the guy we're going to use, he's trained for it. No, no, absolutely.

But I think at that point it won't be better if we make a split between new class and managed class, for example. So that you have a screen where you actually create a new class.

## WhatsApp Feedback

Below is the complete transcript from our April 15 meeting. 

> Hi Johnny, I sent you an email about the Wecoza notes and the goodies that I looked at and that we talked about this morning. I'm going to briefly explain it to you today, because I have also briefly settled it in the email that you will be able to understand when you look at it. I sent you an attachment that says Class Types and Durations.  
> On your Class Types drop-down you have all the Class Types that you can insert. And then there are levels and modules for each Class Type. I think the Class Subject tab that you already have, the drop-down, is a good place to take us out.  
> Then I think under the learner, if you now choose Class Type 80 Communication, then when you choose the learner line, the level that it will start at, then you don’t have to have any drop‑downs of any specific Class Type to choose from. Because we will eventually have the same problems here, as we did in the original Wecoza note. If we make it all fixed, and we have a learner with something else there, then you can’t change it again.  
> I don’t just want to stay with one subject for your class. I want you to choose one per learner. We can choose this class type, and then choose this learner level or module that you are working on.  
> Then we also choose a specific subject for the class. I hope that makes sense. I just put the code in there.  
> You can use it if you want to work on the code. It doesn’t make a big deal. I think it will be easier than this learner view to work on the code, and not the whole description.  
> Then I put in the origin. My idea behind it, and you can still think a little whether it will work, My idea behind it is, If you choose the class type, and we say this is an IIT Communication, then we automatically know that this is a 120‑hour‑long project. Because they will do it on a lead‑in level.  
> A reschedule automatically, if you put in the start date, and the time of the class, it will work automatically. If you say, it starts today, and is every Tuesday, 12 to 3. So it’s a 3‑hour day. It will sit on the schedule for 3 hours every Tuesday, until it reaches 120 hours.  
> Then it maps out the whole schedule, from start to finish, then 120 hours, and it automatically gives you your stop time. So you don’t have to put in a stop time. My idea behind this is to say, if we reschedule according to this time, according to the class type that you put in, then it’s already automated.  
> I don’t think it’s possible to put in automated routers. Obviously, I think there can be routers that come up, that already clash with the automation, if it doesn’t work itself, but I think we can deal with that. I said, I think there should be an override.  
> It automatically follows this time, but if there should be something else, or if you need to change something, you can manually update that. But I hope that makes sense. Obviously, someone still has to talk to us, which I don’t know yet, how we’re going to work it in, and where it’s going to fit, whether it comes to the class, or whether it comes to Anastar, or whether it comes later on.  
> It’s obviously the progression from one level of module to the other. So, if I now, if I admin the business and give it to someone, for example, you’ll see the following order, it’s not 100% not like, for example, if I give it to someone, it starts with LP19 and then 1.2. That’s exactly the order that we’re doing. So that’s the order that has to run fast.  
> So, for example, if you, for example, if you’re doing business admin in class 2, then our learners are going to start on LP9. And it’s going to run fast for 80 hours, and then it automatically has to switch to the next module for 64 hours. And so it has to start automatically until the whole thing is done, because it’s one program.  
> But, my issue comes from the learners, for example, who are just starting out, and it’s going to take an hour or two. Let’s still, if you want the progression to the next module to be automatic, but it also has to be somewhat manual, it wouldn’t run fast according to the schedule. My idea was that it was originally when the portfolio comes in and we scan it in.  
> As soon as you scan it in, it automatically goes to the next module. But I think that’s something we need to talk about, because I don’t know where it’s going to fit into the process, that part. Then, so that’s that attachment.  
> You’ll see that I have it in class type of work package, excel package, run package. Those are packages that do almost anything in a package. It’s not specifically limited to a certain package or anything.  
> If that is selected, they have to manually start and stop it. I still don’t know how we’re going to automate that. I don’t think it’s possible at this point, so I think if we automate it manually, it will run manually.  
> So I think that’s on that attachment. Then I have the events creation attachment, which just shows when we create it last. The only event that needs to be created there is the start and stop date, which can be automatically automated.  
> The material delivery dates when the material needs to be delivered. And then I put something there, alternate options. There are a lot of times that students say, I want to train every second week, or every last week, Saturday of the month, or something like that.  
> So that should also be an option to be able to toggle so well. It’s not every Tuesday and Wednesday, for example, is training. But you can say, every second week, or every second Monday, or every Tuesday, that type of training we can obviously incorporate.  
> Then the rest of the training is under class management, which we can manage. We need to be able to choose an event and a date, when an event is absent, when it’s cancelled. We also need to be able to change if any dates and events are on a schedule.  
> Because we also know what happens if, for example, a delivery or a collection is delayed, change the courier, or the clothing, it’s not right, or whatever. We just need to be able to change dates. It doesn’t have to be fixed like you downloaded it the first time.  
> And then all the other dates and events that we can get directly on that schedule. I put it there. And then under the learners, I just put it there.  
> Obviously, I take the learners track, that list of which we can choose, and I still take it from the client that you downloaded to the learner. And then also, if you chose a sponsor, let him still take it. Because you choose before you get the class, the client.  
> So that those are the options that you get. Because I think that’s going to be the best way. And I just said it again, I think the level and the module must be assigned per learner, and not for the class alone.  
> Because I just made a table of how I think we should view the learner. So I think his ID number, his name, his status, I changed it so that I don’t have to go through everything that you have there. If you have three, it’s CIC, which is current and class, RBE, remote by employer, or DRO, which is a drop‑down.  
> Then the current level must be a drop‑down, which is as I said, where we are going to depend on what the class type you selected. You choose the level of the learner there. New actions is fine.  
> I could have solved it as it is, to just say remove. We can also add a later action of the progression, which I just explained when you go from one thing to another, that you can change the drop‑down or something. We’ll come back to that conversation next time.  
> And then lastly, I just added new class and class management. So I just added what are the functions that can now be under new class and what they can select and insert. And then what you now have on there can fall under class management, which you can write.  
> I added one thing to the new class creation and that is the invoice method of how this project is being invoiced. If you can just put it as a drop‑down, they can select it and all the other good things will be there. I just added a lot of this and exam, also the type of exams that you can insert as a drop‑down.  
> And I think, obviously, again, the exam option should just be given depending on the class type that you select. So I just put the class type that includes exams there. If you choose any of the other class types, I think the exam option should come up here.  
> It makes sense, actually. So I hope everything makes sense and that you understand. If there is something that you don’t know, then I can’t explain it.
