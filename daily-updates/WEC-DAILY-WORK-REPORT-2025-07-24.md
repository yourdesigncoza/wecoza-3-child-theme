## 5. Blockers / Notes

* **Plugin Dependency:** Theme now requires standalone WeCoza Learners Plugin for learner functionality
* **Shortcode Usage:** Any existing content using removed shortcodes will display as plain text
* **Migration Path:** Sites using these shortcodes need to install the learners plugin before updating
* **Architecture:** Theme is now significantly lighter and more focused on core functionality
