*Removed entire `/assets/learners/` directory (4,500+ lines)*

* **Core Files Removed:**
  * `learners-function.php` (303 lines) - contained the conflicting function
  * `learners-capture-shortcode.php` (545 lines) - form functionality
  * `learners-update-shortcode.php` (565 lines) - update form functionality

  * Multiple component files (learner-info, learner-detail, learner-poe, etc.)
  * Documentation files (PortfolioUploadAnalysis.md, summary-final.md)
  * Display JavaScript and utilities

#### **MVC Architecture Cleanup**

*Removed learner MVC components from theme structure*

* `app/Controllers/LearnerController.php` (60 lines) - MVC controller
* `app/Models/Learner/LearnerModel.php` (219 lines) - data model
* `app/Views/learner/learner-form.view.php` (109 lines) - form view
* Updated `app/ajax-handlers.php` to remove learner AJAX references
